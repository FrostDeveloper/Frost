#Official Frost development/staging tree
=============================================================

##What is Frost?

Frost is a Scrypt PoW/PoS currency which will be used as the backbone token for the upcoming Frost sidechain
implementations. FSX coins will hold a multitude of use cases, such as coloured coin/asset creation, FrostWeb/
FrostMarket masternode collateral, fees on the FSX network, collateral for sidechain creation, and much more.
The Frost project began on July 10, 2016 through a group of likeminded students with a heart for innovation
and fame. The FrostChain is in its early stages as a commandline client, with a future GUI overhaul to simplify
the sidechain generation, management, and viewing process.
